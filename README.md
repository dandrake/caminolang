# Camino: a toy language for describing a route

Camino is a little domain-specific language for describing a route --
typically a walk, hike or bike ride, but you can probably use it for
most 1-dimensional geospatial things.

## Inspiration

I've been learning [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/#easy-dsls), which
is a "language-oriented programming language". It seems it's good for
making new <abbr title="domain-specific language">DSL</abbr>s, and I
wanted to experiment with that.

Camino -- Spanish for "way" or "road" -- is my toy DSL experiment. The
name is inspired by the [Camino de
Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) in Spain.
